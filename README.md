This project contains:
-Resources folder - for docs;
-logs folder - for user logs and error logs;
-const folder - for intefaces with path consts and regex consts;
-service folder - for class which contain main program method;
-run folder - contain run method;

This program write the docnames from doc file into the files (docnames in docname.txt, contracts in contract.txt and others in errorDocs.txt).
If the program run successfully, we write into the user log file report about successfull run. 
In other case we write report about exceptions into the error log file and write error message in user log file.

Test scenario:
-run the main method;
-check the .txt - files in Resources folder.
